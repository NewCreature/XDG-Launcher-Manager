XDG Launcher Manager Issues
---------------------------

[X]Build launcher database from .desktop files in the applications folder.

[X]Look into why Type is not set to Application for new launchers.

[X]Don't set launcher config values for empty fields.

[X]Look into system call to update menus.

   [X]Apparently not needed as the launchers are now showing up as soon as I
	    save.

[X]Look into crash when deleting the last launcher.

   [X]Need to see if it is a good idea to allow text pointers to be NULL in GUI
	    code.

      [X]We'll use an empty string buffer for now. The GUI system could be
         updated to allow NULL strings, but the code is already a mess. It
         should probably be cleaned up before we attempt to add features like
         this.

[ ]Ensure SVG icons can be used. We already allow selecting them, but they seem
   to be lost upon reloading XLM.

[ ]Implement UI.

   [ ]Need a check box for Terminal field.

	 [ ]Improve layout for icon button.

      [ ]We might put all the display information (icon button, icon path, and
         Name edit field) at the top. I think this would give the interface a
				 cleaner look.

   [X]Need a list box to list all of the launchers in the database.

   [X]Need an image button to show the current icon. This button should be
      clickable so we can select a new icon if we want.

      [X]Finish implementing image button. We might consolidate the image button
			   functionality into the standard button. It already supports images, we
				 just need to have it support scaling and margins.

      [X]Ensure image button works properly. Don't know if the push button style
         works.

      [ ]Allow user to select icon when clicking the icon button. We should copy
         the selected icon file to the user data folder and reference it from
				 there. We want the icon to be available even if the user removes the
				 file they selected.

         [ ]Add icon to represent SVG icons for now.

				 [X]Update UI after loading icon so we can immediately see the changes.

      [X]When saving, we should remove un-referenced icons. We should use a
         similar system to the launcher file naming system.

   [X]Need a way to add and delete launchers.

   [X]Need a button to save.

	 [X]Update edit box pointers when changing selected launcher.

	    [X]Figure out why the edit boxes always refer to the first launcher.

	 [X]Look into why edit boxes aren't accepting typed characters.

   [X]Allow name field to remain empty. launcher_list_proc() can return
      "Unnamed" if the string is empty.

[X]Implement saving.

   [X]XLM-created launchers will have a specific filename format. When adding a
      new launcher, we'll want to scan for the first available filename.

   [X]I think we'll want to require the user to initiate a save.

   [X]Implement deleting launchers from storage.
