XDG Launcher Manager Issues
---------------------------

[ ]Build launcher database from .desktop files in the applications folder.

[ ]Implement UI.

   [ ]Need a list box to list all of the launchers in the database.

	 [ ]Need edit boxes for each field in the launcher.

   [ ]Need an image button to show the current icon. This button should be
      clickable so we can select a new icon if we want.

[ ]Implement persistence.

   [ ]The name of the desktop file should be able to be changed when we change
      the launcher's name. We will need to ensure we can't give two launchers
      the same name. This check should be done before deleting the old launcher
      file and saving the new one.

   [ ]We want changes made to be saved automatically, much like the OS settings.

   [ ]We need a method to store the selected icon so we don't rely on it being
      kept in the location it was selected from. Maybe we can store it alongside
      the .desktop file in the applications folder.

   [ ]Make sure we can select SVG icons in addition to .PNG.
