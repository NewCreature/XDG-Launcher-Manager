XDG Launcher Manager Issues
---------------------------

[X]Build launcher database from .desktop files in the applications folder.

[X]Look into why Type is not set to Application for new launchers.

[X]Don't set launcher config values for empty fields.

[ ]Look into system call to update menus.

[ ]Implement UI.

   [X]Need a list box to list all of the launchers in the database.

   [ ]Need an image button to show the current icon. This button should be
      clickable so we can select a new icon if we want.

   [X]Need a way to add and delete launchers.

   [X]Need a button to save.

	 [X]Update edit box pointers when changing selected launcher.

	    [X]Figure out why the edit boxes always refer to the first launcher.

	 [X]Look into why edit boxes aren't accepting typed characters.

   [X]Allow name field to remain empty. launcher_list_proc() can return
      "Unnamed" if the string is empty.

[X]Implement saving.

   [X]XLM-created launchers will have a specific filename format. When adding a
      new launcher, we'll want to scan for the first available filename.

   [X]I think we'll want to require the user to initiate a save.

   [X]Implement deleting launchers from storage.
